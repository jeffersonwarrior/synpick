## [1.6.2] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- Codecov integration for coverage reporting in CI

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows build failure caused by backslashes in import paths (ESM requires forward slashes)
- Fixed CI Security Scan failing when Snyk SARIF file doesn't exist
- Fixed CodeQL Python analysis (removed - this is a TypeScript project, not Python)

### Changed
- Updated CI to require Node 20+ (removed Node 18 support)
- Cross-platform build: moved chmod from shell to Node.js postbuild script
- Upgraded zod from 4.3.3 to 4.3.4 (patch update for looseRecord patternProperties support)
- Updated GitHub Actions: checkout@v6, setup-node@v6, codeql-action@v4

### Removed
- Cleaned up documentation clutter (removed codedocs/ directory and CICD.md)

## [1.6.1] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- Added comprehensive `USAGE.md` documentation with quick start guide, model selection, configuration, system tools, and troubleshooting
- Added centralized version management via `version.txt` (CLI and install script now read from this single source of truth)
- Added `isThinkingModel()` utility function to shared `src/utils/model-utils.ts`
- Added `nvm use --delete-prefix v24.12.0 --silent` to end of install script for consistent Node.js version
- Added `tests/installer-script.test.ts` for installer script validation
- Added `tests/cli-subcommands.test.ts` for comprehensive CLI subcommand testing

### Fixed
- Fixed `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined` in ESM environment (`src/utils/banner.ts`)
- Fixed all `require()` calls for ESM compatibility:
  - `src/models/info.ts`: Replaced `require('./types')` with direct import
  - `src/models/cache.ts`: Replaced `require('path')` with `import { dirname }`
  - `src/ui/user-interface.tsx`: Replaced `require('readline')` with `import { createInterface }`
  - `src/core/app.ts`: Replaced `require('../config')` with `import { AppConfigSchema }`
- Fixed install.sh hardcoded paths - now uses shell variables instead of fixed `/home/agent/` paths
- Fixed install.sh fish shell syntax handling in PATH entries
- Fixed install.sh variable name collision in cleanup function
- Fixed Jest configuration for ESM compatibility (renamed `jest.config.js` to `jest.config.cjs`)
- Fixed Jest timeout handler issues with `forceExit` configuration
- Fixed syntax error in `scripts/build.sh` (removed extra quote)
- Fixed mixed `require()` usage in `src/config/manager.ts` for ESM compatibility
- Fixed duplicate `PathUpdateResult` interface in `src/install/install.ts`
- Removed real `setTimeout` calls from test files to prevent timer leaks

### Changed
- Removed npm registry fallback from installer script - now only uses GitHub sources
- Updated installer to fallback to main branch if version-specific tarball fails
- Removed dual ESLint configuration (kept modern `eslint.config.js`, removed legacy `.eslintrc.js`)
- Added `USAGE.md` and `version.txt` to npm package files array
- Updated README.md with fork note documenting this is a fork of jeffersonwarrior/synclaude
- Updated CLAUDE.md with fork note for CI/CD context
- Removed npm registry references from README.md update instructions
